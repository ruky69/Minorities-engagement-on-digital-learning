### INTRODUCTION

Nelson Mandela believed education was the most powerful weapon to change the world. But not every student has equal opportunities to learn. Effective policies and plans need to be enacted in order to make education more equitable—and perhaps exploratory data analysis carried out will give an insight as to possible solutions that could be implemented.

Current research shows educational outcomes are far from equitable. The imbalance was amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to better understand and measure the scope and impact of the pandemic on these inequities.

Education technology company LearnPlatform was founded in 2014 with a mission to expand equitable access to education technology for all students and teachers. LearnPlatform’s comprehensive edtech effectiveness system is used by districts and states to continuously improve the safety, equity, and effectiveness of their educational technology. LearnPlatform does so by generating an evidence basis for what is working and enacting it to benefit students, teachers, and budgets.

This project would hopefully help uncover trends in digital learning. This would be accomplished with data analysis about how engagement with digital learning relates to factors like district demographics, broadband access, and state/national level policies and events.

This notebook will inform policies and practices that close the digital divide. With a better understanding of digital learning trends, this notebook may help reverse the long-term learning loss among America’s most vulnerable, making education more equitable.

### Problem Statement
The COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the increasing digital divide and long-term learning loss among America’s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.

### AIM
- Explore the state of digital learning in 2020 
- Examine how the engagement of digital learning relates to factors such as district demographics, broadband access, and state/national level policies and events.
